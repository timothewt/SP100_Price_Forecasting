# SP100 Price Forecasting

### Description
This projects retrieves data from the SP100 stocks (the stocks can be changeed), and uses this data to forecast the price of a stock using the historical values.<br/>

### Motivation
The goal of this project was to learn about Recurrent Neural Networks, particularly LSTMs, and to apply them to finance, in order to forecast stocks prices.

### Technologies used
- wikipedia python library, to scrap SP100 companies
- yfinance API (python library), to retrieve stocks prices
- PyTorch, to build and train the AI models

### How to use
Download the main file of the repo, [SP100 - Analysis and Price Forecasting](https://github.com/timothewt/SP100_Price_Forecasting/blob/main/SP100_-_Analysis_and_Price_Forecasting.ipynb), and import them to Google Colab.
You need to select the GPU in the execution environment.
Then you can just execute all the cells in the file.
